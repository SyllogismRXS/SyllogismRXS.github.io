Hi. My name is Kevin DeMarco and I'm a roboticist. I write about robotics,
technology, woodworking, music, and bicycling.

I am the CEO and co-founder of [RIF Robotics
Corp](https://www.rifrobotics.com/). At RIF Robotics, we are developing an
autonomous mobile manipulation robot (AMMR) to perform various logistics tasks
in hospitals.

I also provide software engineering, robotics, machine learning, artificial
intelligence, and embedded design consulting services. If you would like to
inquire about my consulting services, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="Contact me">contact me via e-mail</a>.
